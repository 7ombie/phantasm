This directory contains the four files that are required to use the assembler.
Three of the files form the pipeline (`lexer.js`, then `parser.js`, then
`compiler.js`), while `helpers.js` contains a few helper functions.

Everything outside this directory is used to document, test or license the code
within this directory.
