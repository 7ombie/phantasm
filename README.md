PHANTASM: Portable, Hardened, Asynchronous, Natively Typed, Abstract Stack Machine
==================================================================================

PHANTASM is an assembler that allows you to author WebAssembly modules in a nice, modern
language, instead of repurposing the WebAssembly Text Format.

The name *PHANTASM* is an acronym derived from a description of the language semantics:
*Portable, Hardened, Asynchronous, Natively Typed, Abstract Stack Machine*. The name is
also a description of the WebAssembly Engine, which follows from the fact that PHANTASM
exposes the WebAssembly ISA directly, having no semantics of its own.

## Project Status

The assembler is working, but it needs a test suite, and the docs are not ready. Still,
steady progress is being made, and something mature enough for early adopters should be
available within a few weeks.
