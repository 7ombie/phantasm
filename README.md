### PHANTASM: The Portable, Hardened, Asynchronous, Natively Typed, Abstract Stack Machine

PHANTASM is an assembler that allows you to author WebAssembly modules in a
nice, modern language, instead of repurposing the WebAssembly Text Format.

The name *PHANTASM* is an acronym derived from a description of the language
semantics: *Portable, Hardened, Asynchronous, Natively Typed, Abstract Stack*
*Machine*. The name is also a description of the WebAssembly Engine, which
follows from the fact that PHANTASM exposes the WebAssembly ISA directly,
having no semantics of its own.

The PHANTASM project is in its infancy, and everything available here is
provided purely as a preview (for those that have expressed an interest
in early adoption). Production readiness could take another year or more.
